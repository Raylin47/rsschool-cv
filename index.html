My goal is to become a profesional IT specialist who would be able to solve tough problems.

My strengths are my determination in studying, my punctuality i prefer to be 40 minutes early than 5 minutes late and my readiness of taking responsibility.</p>
            </section><h2>Skills:</h2>
            <p>I would say that i have a basic knowledge of C# (Loops, if functions, arrays etc.) on C# i have been developing a currency convertor and user interface for my assignment work in visual studio for college</p>
            <p>Below is my code example for currency convertor:</p>
       <pre>     
                if (Cmb_from.Text == "$")
            {
                Dollars = double.Parse(txtBox.Text); 
                euro = 0.92;
                Sterling = 0.78;
                yen = 155.36;
                {
                    if (Cmb_to.Text == "£")
                    {
                        result = Dollars * Sterling;
                        lblResult.Text = result.ToString() + "£";
                    }
                    if (Cmb_to.Text == "¥")
                    {
                        result = Dollars * yen;
                        lblResult.Text = result.ToString() + "¥";
                    }
                    if (Cmb_to.Text == "€")
                    {
                        result = Dollars * euro;
                        lblResult.Text = result.ToString() + "€";
                    }
                    if (Cmb_to.Text == "$")
                    {
                        result = Dollars;
                        lblResult.Text = result.ToString() + "$";
                    }
                }
            }
       </pre>    
       <p>this is my code example converting from dollars to any other currency available. I have used variables to store their rate depending on what currency user have chosen. 

 Moreover I also have a basic html, css knowledge i know how to make a decently looking adaptive webpage and even tried to make additional layout for phone view with help of media query of 764px. However unfortunately i dont have any experience programming on javascript. I have been producing a webpage for my college assignment as well. If you want to see it its available on my github account or just get to it by using this link <a href="https://raylin47.github.io/test/">https://raylin47.github.io/test/</a></p>
